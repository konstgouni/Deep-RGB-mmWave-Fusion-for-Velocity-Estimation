# Deep-RGB-mmWave-Fusion-for-Velocity-Estimation
This code is intended for replicating the results that correspond to a manuscript to be submitted for Publication. The inference script evaluates the deep fusion model over consequtive experiments, fusing two consecutive red-green-blue (RGB) image  frames with mmWave reference signal received power measurements and estimates vehicle-UE velocity.
